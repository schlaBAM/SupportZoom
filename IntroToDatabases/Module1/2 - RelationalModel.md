#### Querying relational databases

What steps will a user typically take to set up a database?

How does a user interact with the database?
- Through some sort of app or website

What does it mean that a query language is high-level?
- The query says what we want from the database, but not how to get it - there's a level of abstraction that makes
 writing queries easier. 

What does it mean for a query to be ‘ad-hoc’?

Can users ask the database questions directly or do they always have to go through an application?

Are the queries that are easiest to pose the ones that are easiest to retrieve from the database?

Do queries have closure, and what does that mean?
- asd

Are queries composable, and what does that mean?
- Yes - running another query on top of the previous query's result
